## Description
This project is a blog focused on fall fashion and coding.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
**Templating Engine**: EJS  
**Deployment**: Vercel  
**Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech)

## Features Implemented
- **Dynamic Article Rendering**  
  Articles are dynamically rendered using EJS templates. Data is served via JSON and rendered into the frontend through EJS views. Articles are displayed in a table with the ability to filter by category.

- **Filtering by Category**  
  Articles can be filtered by category using dynamic links (e.g., /articles?category={categoryId}).

- **Add Article Form**  
  Added functionality to allow new articles to be added with real categories from the JSON file.

## Neon.tech Integration
The project integrates with Neon.tech, a cloud-based PostgreSQL database platform, to store and manage articles and their related data (such as title, content, and category). The database connection is handled using environment variables to keep sensitive credentials secure.
